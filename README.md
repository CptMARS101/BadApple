"BAD APPLE" is the title for a video game I am currently working on. It's a zombie survival game set in Brooklyn,NY- or potentially a 'faux' Brooklyn.
I hope to have a working single-player demo for my final project in Software Engineering school. That would be sometime in March, '24.
My hope is to eventually have a multiplayer system and some dedicated servers for players to use.
